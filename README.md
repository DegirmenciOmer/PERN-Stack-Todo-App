## Setup

### Repository cloning and npm packages installations

- Navigate to the desired location in your favourite terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/DegirmenciOmer/PERN-Stack-Todo-App`
- `cd server` and then `npm i` This will install the required packages of the backend.
- When you are done with that, `cd ../client` and then `npm i` to install frontend packages

- create a `.env`file under `client` directory and add `REACT_APP_DEV_URL=http://localhost:5000` this is the URL to get your client app connected to the server.

### Database connection

- Make sure you already installed postgresl in your machine.
- Open `database.sql` in your code editor.
- Open a new terminal
- type `psql` and then follow the instructions.
- type `\l` to see the list of databases in your local
- Copy the first command in `database.sql` file and paste it in your terminal. This will create a new database which you will be using during our project.
- type `\l` again to see that perntodo is initialized as one of the databases in your local
- type `\c perntodo`
- Then successively copy and paste the next two commands in `database.sql` so that we can initialize the two tables we need in our project
